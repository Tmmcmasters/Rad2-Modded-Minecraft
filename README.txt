Notes

To turn of the server type stop in the console window and hit enter

The Server is joinable after [Server thread/INFO] [co.gi.al.ic.IceAndFire/] appears in the console

Don't want to bother with all setup and manual pack updates? Rent an already configured server with automatic serverpack instal, update and easy-to-use control panel where you can configure many things.
